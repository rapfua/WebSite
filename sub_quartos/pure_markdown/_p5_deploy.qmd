-   When preview yields the desired result in VsCode, compress the
    directory that contains "script.qmd" & "app.py" and upload to
    RStudio in posit.cloud

-   In posit.cloud's RStudio, do: script.qmd \> Run Document (you will
    not get a good result, don't worry)

-   rsconnect add --account rfua --name rfua --token


-   rsconnect deploy shiny -n rfua . (This can take up to three minutes)

-   Possible to develop directly from posit.cloud's RStudio by doing:

    -   script.qmd \> Run Document
    -   app.py \> Run App
    -   this makes it possible to see intermediary results.
